# ResourcePack
So i have planned some stuff to implement in this pack. Soooooo...
Here's the plan

1. Make plain textures (no animated ones cause i have no idea how)
2. Change the in-game names of retextured items/block/etc to boost immersion of the pack
3. Learn how to make animated textures
4. Change the textures so they are properly animated
5. Keep adding stuff i will ccome up with 
6. Make improvements to the textures

So thats it, I hope it get my view on this thing and what I wanna do.
